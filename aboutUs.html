        Mang Inasal, the Philippines' Grill Expert, is known to customers 
        as the brand that delightfully serves Ihaw-Sarap food and Unli-Saya 
        experience for the past 20 years.<br><br>

        From a Hiligaynon word for Mr. Barbecue, Mang Inasal was established 
        on December 12, 2003 in Iloilo City by Edgar “Injap” Sia II. Apart 
        from the delicious, craveable taste of its Chicken Inasal that has won 
        the hearts of Filipinos, Mang Inasal was also the first to offer 
        unlimited rice. Over the years, the brand has garnered numerous awards 
        as a fast-growing local food company, an outstanding quick service 
        restaurant (QSR), and an excellent Filipino franchise.<br><br>
      
        Mang Inasal eventually became part of the portfolio of Jollibee Foods 
        Corporation (JFC) in April 2016. Since then, Mang Inasal has observed 
        the same high standards of Food, Service and Cleanliness that all JFC 
        brands have been known for. At Mang Inasal, this commitment is applied 
        across the business, assuring customers of food quality and safety that 
        they can enjoy whether dine in, takeout, or delivery.

      <p class="aboutDescription">
        To date, Mang Inasal operates over 570 stores nationwide, 
        97% of which are franchised.<br><br>

        All these efforts enabled Mang Inasal to land the top 4th spot among 
        QSRs in the country and as the number one inasal destination in Manila, 
        according to Southeast Asia's leading travel inspiration platform, 
        TripZilla.<br><br>

        As part of continuously providing Unli-Saya to its customers, Mang Inasal's presence 
        on social media has been intensified. In 2022, Mang Inasal Nation, 
        the first restaurant-managed social community, was launched. With over 
        100,000 members, the exclusive Facebook Group has brought the brand and 
        customers together in one platform.<br><br>

        Mang Inasal has maintained a strong portfolio that includes the best-tasting 2-in-1 sa Laki, 
        Tagos ang Ihaw-Sarap Chicken Inasal, Pork Barbecue, Extra Creamy Halo-Halo, 
        and Palabok, continuously delighting its growing customer base whether via 
        dine-in, takeout, or delivery.<br><br>

        Today, Mang Inasal continues its winning tradition of excellence to 
        provide its customers the best Ihaw-Sarap food and Unli-Saya experience 
        wherever and however they want to enjoy it.
